        <h1>How to use Text</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is how to use <strong>strong</strong> to bold a word with meaning.</p>
        <p>This is how to use <em>em</em> to italicize a word with meaning.</p>
        <p>We can also use <b>b</b> and <i>i</i> to bold and italicize words but they do not convey meaning. Screen readers do not read these correctly.</p>
