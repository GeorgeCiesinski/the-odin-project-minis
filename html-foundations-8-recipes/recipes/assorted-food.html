    <p>I don't believe in food blogs, but for this I'll make an exception.</p>
    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p>When I was let go from my job, I had to come up with an affordable meal anyone can make for <strong>FREE</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Food waste from local restaurant's dumpsters</li>
        <li>Waste oil from local restaurants</li>
        <li>1 staff member from local restaurant</li>
        <li>Just a bit of magic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up the waste oil on top of a burning dumpster, about medium high heat</li>
        <li>Dump in the food, order doesn't matter</li>
        <li>This is where the magic comes in. You need to cast a spell from the order of death while speaking Belphegor's name backwards 3 times</li>
        <li>Sacrifice the staff member to complete the spell</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong>Do not eat the sacrificed staff member or Belphegor <em>lord of gluttony</em> will consume <strong>your</strong> soul instead.</p>
